# Contributing to Revibe

Revibe is opinionated by design.

It values:
- judgment over rules
- clarity over completeness
- usefulness over cleverness

If you enjoy arguing about semicolons, this is not your project.

## What Makes a Good Contribution

We especially welcome:
- clearer heuristics
- better signal explanations
- real-world examples
- improvements to prompt quality
- tests that reflect actual developer pain

A contribution that removes noise is better than one that adds features.

### What We Are Not Optimizing For
- exhaustive correctness
- language-lawyer precision
- enterprise compliance
- one-size-fits-all rules

There are excellent tools for that already.

## Design Principles

Before submitting a change, ask:
1. Does this help a developer decide what to do next?
2. Does this respect human judgment?
3. Would this still be useful if the AI was wrong?

If the answer is no, rethink it.

## Code Style

- Prefer readability over abstraction
- Prefer explicitness over cleverness
- Keep heuristics explainable in plain language

If you cannot explain a signal in two sentences, it probably does not belong.

## Pull Requests

Good pull requests:
- are small
- do one thing
- explain why the change exists
- include examples where possible

We care more about reasoning than volume.

**Final Note**

Revibe is not trying to win benchmarks.
It is trying to help developers and AI work better together.

If that excites you, welcome.
